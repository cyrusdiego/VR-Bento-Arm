/*
************************************************The config file...***************************************************
The file is order dependent. The first mesh is assumed to be the base. Each mesh is then added, as a child, to the previous one.

SYNTAX DETAILS
==============

DATA-LINES (the meat n' potatoes):
fileName.obj : 3D-origin(3D float) : KinematicType ('R' for rotational, 'T' for transformative) : leftLimit (1D float or 'inf' for infinite) : rightLimit (1D float or 'inf' for infinite) : speedConversionRatio (1D float)

COMMENTS:
Single-line: // The line
Multi-line: /* Some lines */

/*
ADVANCED SYNTAX DETAILS
=======================

SYMBOLS (like C-Macros, but use only literal values):
#define symbol-name symbol-value

SINGLE PARENT -- MULTIPLE CHILDREN (ie. 1 hand, 5 fingers):
parent-data-line
{
child1-data-line
child2-data-line
...
}

EXAMPLE CONFIG FILE
===================

/*These are the .obj files which comprise the robot arm used for which this software was created.
Notice that it has only 1 Single Parent -- Multi child relationship, with only 2 'grippers'

Feel free to put comments after your KinematicChain specification, they will be ignored by the
parser, just like the other comments.
